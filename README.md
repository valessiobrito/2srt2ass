# How to use

Upload 2 srt files, the script will send you a SSA/ASS subtitle files. This file will have on top the fisrt file's subtitles and on bottom those of the second file.

If you have any problem, make sure both your files are formatted in SubRip (srt) and are using the same encoding (like UTF-8).
